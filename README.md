# FlappyBird
A Simple Flappy Bird Game written entirely on Python 3.9.0<br>
The Flappy Bird game is commonly dubbed as FlapPyBird as it is mostly written in Python.
It is orginally created by **CodeWithHarry (Haris Khan)** and the real `Source Code` can be found on his [Website](https://www.codewithharry.com).
My Flappy Bird game is somehow edited version of that source code.
